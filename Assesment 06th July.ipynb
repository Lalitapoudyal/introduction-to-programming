    "The linear_search function takes two arguments: an array (arr) and a target element (target).The function iterates through each index of the array using a for loop and the range(len(arr)) construct.Within the loop, it checks if the element at the current index (i) is equal to the target element.If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index (i) where the target element is found.If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not found in the array.In the example usage, an array (numbers) and a target element (target_number) are defined.The linear_search function is called with the array and the target element. The result is stored in the result variable.If the result is not -1, it means the target element is found in the array. The code prints a message indicating the index at which the element is found.If the result is -1, it means the target element is not found in the array. The code prints a message indicating that the element was not found."

    "Define function binary_search with arguments: the array (arr), the target element (target), and the lower and upper bounds (low and high) of the search space within the array. These bounds are initially set to 0 and the length of the array minus 1, respectively.Inside the function, the low and high parameters are re-initialized to 0 and len(arr) - 1 respectively. After that The while loop runs as long as the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer. If the pointers cross each other, it means the target element is not present in the array.Within the loop, the middle index (mid) is calculated by finding the average of low and high using integer division (//).The code checks if the element at the mid index is equal to the target element. If it is, the function returns the mid index, knowing the target is found.If the element at the mid index is less than the target element, it means the target can only exist in the right half of the search space. Therefore, the low pointer is updated to mid + 1 to search in the right half.If the element at the mid index is greater than the target element, it means the target can only exist in the left half of the search space. Therefore, the high pointer is updated to mid - 1 to search in the left half.If the target element is not found after the while loop terminates, the function returns -1 to indicate that the element was not found in the array.In the program, the binary_search function is called with an  array, target element, and initial lower and upper bounds. The result is stored in the result variable.If the result is not -1, it means the target element is found in the array. The code prints a message indicating the index at which the element is found.If the result is -1, it means the target element is not found in the array. The code prints a message indicating that the element was not found."
